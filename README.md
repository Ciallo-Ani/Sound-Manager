# Sound Manager
Plugin for managing sound entities in games Counter-Strike: Source and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

# Requirements:
* [Metamod:Source](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php?branch=stable) and [SourceMod 1.10 or above](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable) installed.
* [DHooks](https://github.com/peace-maker/DHooks2/releases)

# Commands:
* !snd
* !sound
* !sounds
* !music
* !stopmusic
* !stopsounds

# Warning:

If the sound has started playing, then you can stop it only by writing `snd_restart` to the console, perhaps in the future I will add the ability to stop active sounds without using this command
